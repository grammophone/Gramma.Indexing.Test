# Gramma.Indexing.Test
This is a sample WPF application for demonstration and testing 
of the [Gramma.Indexing](https://github.com/grammophone/Gramma.Indexing) library. It allows the user to experiment 
with the various type of trees provided, to visualize their structure and test the approximate search functionality 
with standard Levenshtein distance metrics (a character match costs 0 while additions, changes and removals cost 1).
